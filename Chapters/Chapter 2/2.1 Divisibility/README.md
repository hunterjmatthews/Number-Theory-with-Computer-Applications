# Problems
### Problem 24
We want to generalize the results of the previous two exercises. Fix an
integer $m$ between 5 and 20 and make a table of values $n^{m} - n$ for different $n$, say
$n$ in the range 2 through 25. Does $m$ divide all of these? Do this for all $m$ satisfying
$6 \leq m \leq 20$. Make a reasonable conjecture about the numbers $m$ for which $n^{m} - n$
is always divisible by $m$. Can you prove your conjecture?
### Problem 25
The Fibonacci numbers are defined by: $f_{1} = 1$, $f_{2} = 1$, $f_{n} = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$.
Hence, $f_{3} = f_{2}+f_{1} = 1 + 1 = 2$, $f_{4} = f_{3} + f{2} = 2 + 1 = 3$, and so on. Make a table
of the first 50 Fibonacci numbers. Which ones are even? Similarly, identify the multiples
of 3, of 5, and of other odd numbers. Prove your conjecture in a few cases. If $m$ is an odd number,
there may not seem a way to all Fibonacci numbers divisible by $m$. But in the special case when
$m$ is a Fibonacci number $f_{d}$ it is possible to find the Fibonacci numbers that are multiples
of $f_{d}$. Determine the multiples of $f_{d}$ and prove your conjecture.
### Problem 26
Make a list of a few odd primes p that can be written as a sum of two squares (i.e., as $p = x^{2}+y^{2}$); for example, $5 = 2^{2} + 1^{2}$, $13 = 3^{2}+2^{2}$. What is the remainder when these primes are divided by 4? Prove your guess about the form of the remainder by first showing that one of $x$ or $y$ must be odd and the other even.
